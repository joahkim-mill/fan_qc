# Delta (Exhaust) Fan In-House Quality Control Metric

This plots sweep recordings recorded on Room EQ Wizard(REW) to understand differences between good and bad fan quality. The aim is to be able to visualize certain peak frequencies consistent only in bad fans to root them out before being installed in units.

This is available on [Streamlit](https://deltafanqc.streamlit.app/) or can be run locally via [fan_qc.py](https://github.com/joahkim-mill/fan_qc/blob/main/fan_qc.py)
